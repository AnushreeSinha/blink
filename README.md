Blink is a framework for developers to create J2EE applications in short time from templated architectural patterns. Blink strives to auto generate complete multi-tier mobile compatible applications with business defined entity definitions and pre-defined set of J2EE APIs/architectural patterns. 
Modern applications means support for Cloud, HTML5, federated social security, asynchronous processing, high throughput and low response time.  
This application was created for the ease of developers, so that they could avoid the repetitive coding of standard POJO classes, at the Business and Data layers. 
The application requires inputs like the entities and the relationships between them, and generates BOs (Business Objects), DTOs(Data Transfer Objects) and DAO(Data Access Objects) for these entities using JCodeModel. The UI was designed using ExtJS.
